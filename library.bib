@book{Iiffe2008,
abstract = {Over the years since its first appearance, Datums and Map Projections has become a key book for many students and professionals around the world. Its theme - a practical guide to coordinate reference systems - is as important now as when it was first published, probably more so when we consider the ever growing use of satellite navigation systems and the introduction of web mapping services such as Google Earth. While retaining the benefits of the first edition - clear presentation assuming no prior knowledge, a problem-solving approach, practical examples and the combination of GPS-derived data from other sources - the rewritten and expanded second edition offers very much more: This new edition, now with a co-author, will maintain the book's reputation as the ideal guide to the subject for years to come.},

@article{Kraak2003,
abstract = {In recent years, the visualization of geospatial data has undergone dramatic and important developments. Next to static maps, nowadays, immersive and highly interactive virtual environments can be used to explore and present dynamic geospatial data. Additionally, the World Wide Web has developed into a prominent medium to disseminate geospatial data and maps. In visualizing geospatial data, methods and techniques from fields, such as scientific visualization and information visualization, are applied because of the large volumes of data at hand. This has accumulated in what is known as geovisualization - the use of visual geospatial displays to explore data and through that exploration to generate hypotheses, develop problem solutions and construct knowledge. Maps and other linked graphics play a key role in this process. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of geovisualization and, in particular, how alternative graphic representations can stimulate the visual thought process. This is demonstrated by applying geovisualization techniques to Minard's well-known map of Napoleon's 1812 campaign into Russia, the "Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l'Armee Fran{\c{c}}aise dans la campagne de Russie 1812-1813" (http://www.itc.nl/personal/kraak/1812/). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Wise2000,
abstract = {In a recent paper, Peter Fisher discussed some of the problems with modelling geographical reality using raster GIS, pointing out that 'the pixel ... is a delusion which may become a snare for the unwary given the way it is treated in most modern software' (Fisher 1997). In my own work on the effect of DTM interpolation errors (Wise 1998, in press) I have encountered many of the snares referred to and I have come to the conclusion that many of them are symptomatic of deficiencies in the data modelling facilities provided by current GIS. The purpose of this editorial is to provoke discussion of some of these issues. Goodchild (1992) states that 'a GIS will only be successful if it can present the user with an accurate view of the world; to do so requires ... the use of accurate data models'. The process of constructing a database can be seen as a sequence of data modelling steps, each moving further towards the representation of the phenomena of interest in computer form. Worboys (1995) describes this sequence of data models as follows: - Application Domain Model-a representation of the system of interest in a form comprehensible to people familiar with the system. -Conceptual Computational Model-a representation of the application domain model in a form which is inherently computable, but which is not tied to any particular software or hardware. Since computers can only represent discrete items of information, the Application Domain Model must be represented in terms of discrete entities. -Logical Computational Model-a representation of the Conceptual Computational Model according to a particular type of computer software. -Physical Computational Model-the implementation of the logical computational model on a particular type of computer hardware. In the database field there are a number of well established methodologies for building a database by constructing a similar series of models (Eva 1994, Oracle 1998). The advantage of this approach is that the models provides users with an appropriate view of the database, with technical details of lower level models hidden from them. My argument is that this sort of modelling is poorly implemented in current GIS, leading to problems for GIS users. Part of the problem is that there is a lack of agreement in the GIS literature about what the stages of data modelling are. Much of the literature refers to a scheme described in Peuquet (1984) in which there are only three stages-data model, data structure and file structure (DeMers 1997, Heywood et al. 1998) with the two main GIS models-vector and raster- equating with the Conceptual Computational Model in the Worboys scheme. However, the vector and raster data models as implemented in current GIS software are not truly Conceptual models, but are to some extent Logical models, a fact which has been pointed out by others (Goodchild 1992, Jones 1997). To illustrate why this is a problem I will concentrate initially on the Raster model.},

@article{Egenhofer1990,
abstract = {One of the fundamental concepts necessary for the analysis of spatial data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) is a formal understanding of the geometric relationships among arbitrary spatial objects. Topological relations, a particular subset of geometric relations, are preserved under topological transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. A comprehensive formal categorization of such binary topological relations between regions, lines, and points has been developed that is based upon the comparison of the nine intersections between the interiors, boundaries, and exteriors of the two objects. The basic criterion for the distinction of different topological relations is whether the intersections are empty or not, thus identifying 2 mutually exclusive topological relations. It is derived which of these 512 binary relations actually exist in IR between regions, lines, and points. An equivalent model is developed that replaces the intersections with exteriors by subset conditions of the closure so that efficient implementations of topological relations are possible in geographic information systems.},

@article{Skupin2003,
abstract = {Information visualization is an interdisciplinary research area in which cartographic efforts have mostly addressed the handling of geographic information. Some cartographers have recently become involved in attempts to extend geographic principles and cartographic techniques to the visualization of non-geographic information. This paper reports on current progress and future opportunities in this emerging research field commonly known as spatialization. The discussion is mainly devoted to the computational techniques that turn high-dimensional data into visualizations via processes of projection and transformation. It is argued that cartographically informed engagement of computationally intensive techniques can help to provide richer and less apaque information visualizations. The discussion of spatialization methods is linked to another priority area of cartographic involvement, the development of theory and principles for cognitively plausible spatialization. The paper distinguishes two equally important sets of challenges for cartographic success in spatialization research. One is the recognition that there are distinct advantages to applying a cartographic perspective in information visualization. This requires our community to more thoroughly understand the essence of cartographic activity and to explore the implications of its metaphoric transfer to non-geographic domains. Another challenge lies in cartographers becoming a more integral part of the information visualization community and actively engaging its constituent research fields.},
